# algorithm-basics
This file is to keep a record of the findings and practice problems I encountered while studying the basics of data structures and algorithms in Python.\

The overall structure is as follows:
1. `greedy.py` -- goes over the greedy algorithm*
2. `implementation.py` -- provides solutions to implementation problems*
3. `search.py` -- covers Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-FIrst Search (DFS), focusing on their different uses and runtimes*
4. `sort.py` -- introduces Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Count Sort*
